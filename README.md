# Puzzle Pixel Icons
A Collection of Pixel Art Icons... Originally Developed for Mega Puzzle 2024  

View the full collection of icons using the [Icon Catalogue](https://nouveaureece.github.io/Puzzle-Pixel-Icons/)


## Recommended Method
For a number of reasons including accessibility and stability, it is recommended that one use `<svg>` and `<use>` for SVG icons over icon fonts. (Learn more in ["Seriously, Donâ€™t Use Icon Fonts"](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/seriously-dont-use-icon-fonts/) by Tyler Sticka)  

### Install
Copy the `icons.svg` file to your project directory (or, if you really have to, copy/paste its contents into your HTML file)

### Usage
Include the following HTML whenever using an icon, replacing with your desired icon from the [Icon Catalogue](https://nouveaureece.github.io/Puzzle-Pixel-Icons/): 
```
<svg role="img">
    <title>A rubber duck with its wings tucked against its body</title>
    <use xlink:href="icons.svg#ppi-duck">
</svg>
```
Including the `<title>` element will provide both `aria-label` and hover tooltip functionality (and is highly encouraged)! If the icon is decorative, be sure to include `aria-hidden="true"` on the `<svg>` element.

**Note:** it is not required that you include `role="img"` on your `<svg>` element. That being said, a squashed bug in WebKit (Safari, iOS, macOS) did prevent SVGs from being read as images at one point, and this was a solution to that issue.

## Alternate Method
### Install
If one choses to forgo the above method and use an "icon font" method, one can import the CSS by simply adding this `<link>` within the `<head>` section of an HTML file...
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://nouveaureece.github.io/Puzzle-Pixel-Icons/pixel-icons.css">
```
... or in a CSS file with `@import`:
```
@import url("https://nouveaureece.github.io/Puzzle-Pixel-Icons/pixel-icons.css")
```
### Usage
Simply include an `<i>` tag which conforms to the proper `ppi-...` class. For example, this would display the check mark icon:
```
<i class="ppi-check"></i>
```


## Accessibility
It's a good idea to be as accessible as possible, so if you are using an icon for purely decorative reasons, be sure to include `aria-hidden="true"` on the tag. For example:
```
<!-- A button with a decorative icon -->
<a href="...">

    <svg role="img" aria-hidden="true">
        <use xlink:href="icons.svg#ppi-duck">
    </svg>

    Buy a Rubber Duck
</a>
```
