## Install
To import the CSS for these icons onto a page, simply add this `<link>` within the `<head>` section of your HTML file...
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://nouveaureece.github.io/Puzzle-Pixel-Icons/pixel-icons.css">
```
... or in a CSS file with `@import`:
```
@import url("https://nouveaureece.github.io/Puzzle-Pixel-Icons/pixel-icons.css")
```
## Usage
You're welcome to borrow and use these icons! Simply include an `<i>` tag which conforms to the proper `ppi-...` class. For example, this would display the check mark icon:
``` 
<i class="ppi-check"></i>
```

## Accessibility
It's a good idea to be as accessible as possible, so if you are using an icon for purely decorative reasons, be sure to include `aria-hidden="true"` on the tag. For example:
```
<!-- A button with a decorative icon -->
<a href="...">
Buy a Rubber Duck <i class="ppi-duck" aria-hidden="true">
</a>
```
